; PlatformIO Project Configuration File
;
;   Build options: build flags, source filter
;   Upload options: custom upload port, speed and extra flags
;   Library options: dependencies, extra library storages
;   Advanced options: extra scripting
;
; Please visit documentation for the other options and examples
; https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html

; NOTE: This is an example platformio.ini file to be used as a template for
; derived projects. Do not use the file within the SensESP directory tree but
; instead create a new project in PlatformIO and copy this file and one of the
; example source files there.

; This one has all merged PR's, but is not yet an official "release" version.
; It is the branch called "master". This version is unstable and under continuous
; development and will break without warning. Use it only if you want to
; participate in SensESP development or need to test some yet unreleased feature.
